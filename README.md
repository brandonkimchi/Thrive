Thrive is a mobile app my group came up with at the CODE_EXP DSTA BRAINHACK 2024 Hackathon

# About
### Problem Statement

**How can we effectively reduce food wastage from eateries in Singapore?**

- Significant food wastage from restaurants, cafes, and supermarkets
- Environmental impact due to large amounts of food waste
- Revenue lost for businesses from unsold food

### Solution

**An all in one app that**
- **Connects consumers with discounted surplus food.**
- **Helps restaurants and grocery stores reduce food wastage**
- **Supports those in need (e.g., elderly, migrant workers, low-income families, people with disabilities) through food donations**

### Unique Features

- **Flash Sales**: Attractive discounted surplus food from restaurants and cafes / near expiry or ugly foods from supermarkets
- **Reward System**: Unique tier based point system for consumers to participate; user retention
- **Food Waste & Carbon Footprint Tracker**: Helps businesses monitor and reduce waste
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifications for available discounted food
- **Charity Food Donations**: Merchants can donate excess food to underprivileged communities rather than just disposing the food
- **Collaboration with Government and Social Organizations**: Underprivileged individuals can apply for vouchers in the app for additional discounts on food and groceries\
